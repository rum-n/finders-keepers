            <h1>Things you're probably <br/>wondering about</h1>
            <h3>Is there a trial period?</h3>
            <p>It's completely free to subscribe and view most projects (no credit card needed). In that sense, you have an unlimited trial period. However, some projects are for premium members only. You decide when you want to upgrade.</p>
            <h3>Why should I pay the monthly fee, if I can browse most projects for free?</h3>
            <p>Fair point! You can stay at the free tier and check out all the new free projects, uploaded daily. However, the premium project listings, reserved for paying members are usually harder to find elsewhere.</p>
            <h3>How many projects will I get per month?</h3>
            <p>The platform is updated daily with projects in 4 different areas - UX & UI Design, Graphic Design, Web Development, and Mobile Development. Some days there might be more new projects, other days there might be less. Still, you should expect at least 10-15 new project listings per week.</p>
            <h3>Can I cancel anytime?</h3>
            <p>Sure. You'll still be able to access the platform and browse the free project listings. No hard feelings.</p>
            <h3>Can you guarantee I'll close a deal?</h3>
            <p>No. That's up to you. I'm providing an opportunity, you decide how to approach it. I can give you advice and you can read some useful tips that I also share on the platform (cold email templates, where to find contacts, how to find the decision maker, etc.), but it's up to you how you go about it.</p>
            <h3>How many people am I competing with for any given project?</h3>
            <p>Tough to say. These are public project listings (for now), so people have access to them. It also depends how popular the company is. In any case, it's always worth trying.</p>
